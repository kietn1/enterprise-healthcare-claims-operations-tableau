Healthcare organizations process large volumes of claims across multiple service lines, providers, and member populations. As claim volumes grow, operations teams face increasing pressure to maintain processing efficiency, meet SLA targets, and control medical costs while ensuring consistent reporting across business units.

This project simulates an enterprise healthcare environment and delivers a Tableau dashboard built to support operational oversight at scale. 

The dashboard is designed for enterprise stakeholders, including operations leaders and performance management teams, who require reliable, governed metrics and the ability to quickly identify operational bottlenecks across services, providers, and regions.

Here are examples of some pre-defined business questions the dashboard can answer: 
1. Are healthcare claims being processed within SLA targets across all service types and providers?
2. Which service lines or providers are driving the longest processing times and contributing most to SLA breaches?
3. Where are the largest cost and claim volume concentrations, and how are they trending over time?
